*Welcome to Cruddy’s Car Parts*

In this Solution Pattern, you will be using two applications from a fictitious company called Cruddy’s Car Parts. Both applications are built with PatternFly, an open source design system, and Node.js.

{create-messages-app} - Provides a RESTful API and a user interface to create order messages for customers.

{retrieve-messages-app} - Uses a RESTful API that is built with Red Hat Fuse for querying and creating orders in an underlying PostgreSQL database.

==  Creating an address
// task-scoped attributes
:task-context: creating-connections

To route messages from the {create-messages-app} to the {retrieve-messages-app}, you will need to create an address in Red Hat AMQ Online.

****
*What is Red Hat AMQ?*

Red Hat AMQ is a Red Hat Integration component that enables developers to self-provision messaging queues and topics on OpenShift.
****

Follow these steps to create an address.

. Go to link:{enmasse-url}[Red Hat AMQ, window="_blank", id="{task-context}-1"].
+
NOTE: If this is your first time opening the AMQ console, you will need to authenticate.
. Select the Name/Namespace that corresponds to your username.
. You will now see the AMQ Online console.
. Select *Addresses* from the vertical navigation menu on the left.
. Click the *+Create* button.
. You will see the *Create new address* wizard.
.. In the *Name* field, enter:
+

.. For the *Type*, select *queue* and then click *Next*.
.. For the *Plan*, select *Small Queue* and then click *Next*.
.. On the *Summary* page, select *Create* to complete the wizard.

. Monitor the AMQ Online console until a green check mark is displayed beside the new address.
Creating an address may take some time.

=== Creating an API Connector

Fuse Online is an enterprise integration platform that provides connectors for many services, such as Gmail and IRC.
You can extend Fuse Online with custom connectors, using either OpenAPI definitions (Swagger) or JAR files.
To create a connector for the Fuse RESTful API, register the OpenAPI definition as a *Customization*.

Follow these steps to create an API Connector.

. Log in to the link:{fuse-url}[Red Hat Fuse Online, window="_blank", id="{task-context}-1"] console.
+
NOTE: You are not logging into the shared Fuse Online instance, available from the link:/[All services tab].
Starting this Solution Pattern provisioned an instance of Fuse Online which is not shared with other cluster users.

. Select *Customizations > API Client Connectors* from vertical navigation menu on the left.
. Select the *Create API Connector* button to start the *API Client Connector* wizard.
. When prompted to *Upload OpenAPI Document*, select *Use a URL*:
.. Enter the following in the URL field:
+
[subs="attributes+", id="route-crud-host-url-connector"]
