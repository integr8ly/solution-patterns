Learn how to create a simple integration with built-in monitoring, so you can enable fault tolerant communication between applications.

*Welcome to Cruddy’s Car Parts*

In this Solution Pattern, you will be using two applications from a fictitious company called Cruddy’s Car Parts. Both applications are built with PatternFly, an open source design system, and Node.js.

{create-messages-app} - Provides a RESTful API and a user interface to create order messages for customers.

{retrieve-messages-app} - Uses a RESTful API that is built with Red Hat Fuse for querying and creating orders in an underlying PostgreSQL database.

==  Creating an address
// task-scoped attributes
:task-context: creating-connections

To route messages from the {create-messages-app} to the {retrieve-messages-app}, you will need to create an address in Red Hat AMQ Online.

****
*What is Red Hat AMQ?*

Red Hat AMQ is a Red Hat Integration component that enables developers to self-provision messaging queues and topics on OpenShift.
****

Follow these steps to create an address.

. Go to link:{enmasse-url}[Red Hat AMQ, window="_blank", id="{task-context}-1"].
+
NOTE: If this is your first time opening the AMQ console, you will need to authenticate.
. You will then see your AMQ Online console.
. Make sure that the *Addresses* tab is selected.
. Click the *Create Address* button.
. You will see the *Create new address* wizard.
.. In the *Address* field, enter:
+
[subs="attributes+", id="creating-amq-address-name"]
----
work-queue-requests
----
.. For the *Type*, select *queue*.
.. For the *Plan*, select *Small Queue* and then click *Next*.
.. On the *Review* page, select *Finish* to complete the wizard.

. Monitor the AMQ Online console until a green check mark is displayed beside the new address.
Creating an address may take some time.

==  Creating a table

// task-scoped attributes
:task-context: creating-a-table

To create a table for storing the orders, you will use PostgreSQL.

Follow these steps to create a table.

. Log in to link:{openshift-host}/k8s/cluster/projects/{walkthrough-namespace}[OpenShift Namespace, window="_blank", id="{task-context}-1"] for this walkthrough.
. Select *Workloads > Pods* from the vertical navigation menu on the left.
. Click the Pod that has the name *rhmi-lab-orders-db* followed by an ID, for example *rhmi-lab-orders-db-1-cfqh2*.
. Select the *Terminal* tab on the Pod details screen.
. Log in to the *orders* database using the command:
+
[subs="attributes+", id="psql-table-create-login"]
----
psql -U {user-username} -W -d orders
----
. Enter the following when prompted:
+
[subs="attributes+", id="psql-table-create-password"]
----
password
----
+
For security reasons, the password is not shown in the terminal.
Paste the password then press the *Enter* key.

. Paste the following as SQL to create the `received_orders` table:
+
[subs="attributes+", id="psql-table-create-json"]
----
CREATE TABLE received_orders (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  product text NOT NULL,
  quantity int NOT NULL,
  message_id text NOT NULL,
  datetime timestamp NOT NULL
);

Is the `received_orders` table listed when you enter the `\d` command in the terminal for the PostgreSQL pod?

=== Creating an API Connector

Fuse Online is an enterprise integration platform that provides connectors for many services, such as Gmail and IRC.
You can extend Fuse Online with custom connectors, using either OpenAPI definitions (Swagger) or JAR files.
To create a connector for the Fuse RESTful API, register the OpenAPI definition as a *Customization*.

Follow these steps to create an API Connector.

. Log in to the link:{fuse-url}[Red Hat Fuse Online, window="_blank", id="creating-connections-1"] console.
+
NOTE: You are not logging into the shared Fuse Online instance, available from the link:/[All services tab].
Starting this Solution Pattern provisioned an instance of Fuse Online which is not shared with other cluster users.

. Select *Customizations > API Client Connectors* from vertical navigation menu on the left.
. Select the *Create API Connector* button to start the *API Client Connector* wizard.
. When prompted to *Upload OpenAPI Document*, select *Use a URL*:
.. Enter the following in the URL field:
+
[subs="attributes+", id="route-crud-host-url-connector"]
----
{route-orders-fuse-api-host}/openapi.json
----
.. Click *Next*.

NOTE: If using a cluster that has self signed certs you will not be able to use the URL option described above. You will need to copy the url into a browser and copy the returned JSON into a .json file and use the *Upload OpenAPI Document* instead.

This OpenAPI (swagger) file defines the API for querying and creating orders in the underlying PostgreSQL database.

. When prompted with *Review Actions*, select *Next*.
. When prompted with *Specify Security*, select *Next*.
. When prompted with *Review/Edit Connector Details*:
.. Enter the following in the *Name* field:
+
[subs="attributes+", id="route-crud-host-url-connector-name"]
----
Order System REST API Connector {user-sanitized-username}
