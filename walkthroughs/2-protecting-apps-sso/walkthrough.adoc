Learn how to set up {customer-sso-name} to protect end-user applications by using standards such as OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, and SAML 2.0.

IMPORTANT: You must complete the *{sp1-title}* Solution Pattern before starting this one.

//If I make this a title, it breaks the layout.
*Welcome back to Cruddyâ€™s Car Parts*

In this Solution Pattern, you will continue to use the {create-messages-app} and the {retrieve-messages-app} applications from the _{sp1-title}_ Solution Pattern.
Now, you will protect them from unauthorised access by creating and enabling a single sign-on service.

The following diagram shows the architecture of your solution.

== Creating a client

To secure your application with single sign-on, you must create a _client_ in a _realm_.

Client - The client represents the application being secured. Often, clients are web services that want to use Red Hat Single Sign-On (RHSSO) to secure themselves and provide a single sign-on solution.

Realm - A realm is used to manage a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups. A user belongs to and logs into a realm.
Realms are isolated from one another and can only manage and authenticate the users that they control.

****
*What is Customer Application SSO?*

Customer Application SSO, included with Red Hat Managed Integration, enables you to define the identities of your end users.
Red Hat manages this instance, however there are some additional users with admin level privileges who can configure this instance.
****

IMPORTANT: The realm used in this Solution Pattern is shared with *all* users on the cluster. *Do not use this realm for production applications*.

Follow these steps to create a client.

. Go to the link:{sso-realm-url}[{realm-display-name}, window="_blank"] realm, which is running on your {customer-sso-name} service.
.. If prompted, enter the username `{shared-realm-username}` and password `{realm-password}`.
. You will see the *{realm-name}* realm if the login is successful.
. Select *Clients* from the vertical navigation menu on the left side of the screen.
. Click the *Create* button on the top right of the Clients screen.
. On the *Add Client* screen:
.. In the *Client ID* field, enter
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
{client-name}
----
.. Verify the *Client Protocol* is set to *openid-connect*.
.. In the *Root URL* field, paste the URL of the *{create-messages-app} UI* from the *{sp1-title}* Solution Pattern. This should look similar to `https://order-entry-ui-{user-username}-<NAMESPACE>.{openshift-app-host}`
.. Click *Save*.
. You will see the *Settings* screen for the *{client-name}* client if the save is successful.
. Verify that the *Access Type* field is set to *public*. This means the client is a front-end application that needs to log in using a web browser.

[type=verification]
Select *Clients* from the vertical navigation menu on the left side of the screen.
Is the *{client-name}* client listed in the table with *Enabled* set to *True*?

[type=verificationFail]
In the *Settings* tab on the *Client* page, make sure the *Enabled* toggle is set to *ON*. {standard-fail-text}

== Creating a user

To secure your application with single sign-on and allow additional users to log in to your instance, you need to create users in a realm.

Follow these steps to create a new user and set that user's password.

. Go to the link:{sso-realm-url}[{realm-display-name}, window="_blank"] realm, which is running on your {customer-sso-name} service.
.. If prompted, enter the username `{shared-realm-username}` and password `{realm-password}`.
. You will see the *{realm-name}* realm if the login is successful.
. Select *Users* from the vertical navigation menu on the left side of the screen.
. Click the *Add user* button on the top right of the Users screen.
. On the *Add user* screen:
.. In the *Username* field, enter `customer`.
.. Leave other fields with their default values.
.. Click *Save*.
. The *Details* tab should now be displayed with some additional tabs along the top of the screen.
. Select the *Credentials* tab.
. Using the *Manage Password* form:
.. In the *New Password* field, enter the password `customer-password`.
.. In the *Password Confirmation* field, enter the same password.
.. Set the *Temporary* toggle to the *OFF* position.
+
NOTE: If you leave the *Temporary* toggle in the *ON* position, the user will be forced to create a new password when they perform a login.
.. Click *Reset Password*.
. You will see a *Change password* confirmation modal.
. Click the *Change password* button to confirm your changes.

[type=verification]
Select *Users* from the vertical navigation menu on the left side of the screen. Click the *View all users* button on the top left of the Users screen, next to the Search field.
Do you see the *customer* username listed in the table?

== Enabling SSO in the {create-messages-app}

=== Obtaining the SSO configuration

To secure an application with SSO a *Client Adapter* is required.
Various platforms are supported with *Client Adapters*:

* Spring Boot
* Node.js
* JBoss EAP
* Fuse
* JavaScript (client-side)
* Servlet Filter

{blank}

The *{create-messages-app}* is run from a Node.js server, so the Node.js
`keycloak-connect` adapter is included in the code. The following steps will
demonstrate how to include a configuration and enable the adapter.


. Go to link:{sso-realm-url}[SSO Realm, window="_blank"].
. Enter the username `{shared-realm-username}` and password `{realm-password}` if prompted.
. Select *Clients* from the side menu.
. Click the `{client-name}` client that was created earlier.
. Choose the *Installation* tab.
. Select *Keycloak OIDC JSON* for *Format Option*.
. Click the *Download* button to download this as a _keycloak.json_ file.

=== Creating a SSO Config Map Entry

. Login to the link:{openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].
. Select the project that contains *integration-solution-1-integrate-event-and-api-driven-apps* in the name.
. Select *Resources > Config Maps*.
. Click the *Create Config Map*  button.
.. Enter `order-entry-keycloak-config` in the *Name* field.
.. Enter `KEYCLOAK_CONFIG` in the *Key* field.
.. Click the *Browse* button and select the _keycloak.json_ file that was downloaded in the previous section.
. Click the *Create* button.

=== Applying the SSO Config Map

. Log in to the link:{openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].
. Navigate to the *integration-solution-1-integrate-event-and-api-driven-apps* project.
. Select *Applications > Deployments*.
. Select the *rhmi-lab-nodejs-order-frontend* item from the *Deployments* list.
. Select the *Environment* tab.
.. Click *Add Value from Config Map or Secret*
.. Enter `KEYCLOAK_CONFIG` in the *Name* column.
.. Choose `order-entry-keycloak-config` from the *Select a resource* dropdown.
.. Choose *KEYCLOAK_CONFIG* from the *Select key* menu.
. Scroll down and click *Save*.
. Select *Overview* on the left and find the *rhmi-lab-nodejs-order-frontend* in the list.
. If a deployment is still in progress, wait for it to finish.
. Open the URL listed beside the *rhmi-lab-nodejs-order-frontend* in either a private browser session, or a different browser to view the *{create-messages-app}* UI.
+
NOTE: Use a private session or different browser to avoid conflict with your old sessions.

. A login screen with the title *walkthroughs Realm* is displayed.
. Enter `customer` in the *Username or email*.
. Enter `customer-password` in the *Password* field.
. Click the *Log In* button.

[type=verification]
The login should be successful. Is the *{create-messages-app}* web application displayed?

[type=verificationFail]
If a login page is not presented try opening the *{create-messages-app}* in a private browsing session or different browser. {standard-fail-text}
