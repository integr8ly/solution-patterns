== Deploying the Data Sync showcase application

//Home > Search > Select Templates from the drop down > Search for datasync and they should show up. Just make sure you're on the openshift namespace

. Go to the link:{openshift-host}/topology/ns/{walkthrough-namespace}[project console, window="_blank"] in OpenShift.
. Select the *From Catalog* option.
. Use the *Filter by keyword...* field to search the catalog for `Data Sync Showcase`.
. Select the *Data Sync Showcase* option to add it to your project.
. Click the *Instantiate Template* button.
. Accept all the default values on the provisioning form, scroll down to the bottom of the screen, and click *Create*.
. Go to link:{openshift-host}/k8s/ns/{walkthrough-namespace}/pods[Workloads > Pods, window="_blank"] page for your project. You should see the following three pods:
+
* *ionic-showcase-server* - a Node.js server and client application
* *mosquitto-mqtt-broker* - a message broker
* *postgresql* - a database
+
Wait until you see that all three pods have the *Running* status. Once the pods are running, you can use the GraphQL playground to interact with the server API as described in the next step.

. Go to the link:{route-ionic-showcase-server-host}/graphql[GraphQL playground, window="_blank"].
. Replace the text in the left pane of the screen with the following query and mutation:
----
query listTasks {
  allTasks {
    title,
    description,
    id
  }
}

mutation createTask {
  createTask(title: "complete the walkthrough", description: "complete the GraphQL walkthrough") {
    title,
    description,
    version,
    id
  }
}
----
. Click the execute query/play button in the middle of the playground screen and then select *createTask* from the menu. The system should create a task.
. Click the execute query/play button again and then then select *listTasks* from the menu.

Look at the right side of your playground screen. Do you see the following code displayed?

----
{
    "data": {
        "allTasks": [
            {
                "title": "complete the walkthrough",
                "description": "complete the GraphQL walkthrough",
                "id": "1"
            }
        ]
    }
}

== Accessing the client app in a browser

The {data-sync-showcase-app} demonstrates the key capabilities provided by the {data-sync-name} framework.
It can be run either as a hybrid mobile application, or a Progressive Web App (PWA).

. Go to the link:{route-ionic-showcase-server-host}[AeroGear Showcase, window="_blank"] application.
. Select *Manage Tasks* from the left hand menu.
. Create a task by clicking on the plus icon in the top right-hand side of the screen.
. Add a title and description, of your choosing, to the task and click *Create*.
. Copy the current url without the '/tasks' endpoint and paste in a different desktop or mobile browser window.
. Change the status of the task by clicking/unclicking the text box beside the task.

== Protecting the Data Sync showcase application using Customer Application SSO
Now that your tasks are created in the {data-sync-showcase-app}, you will need to secure both the *front-end* and the *back-end* of the {data-sync-showcase-app} with single sign-on.
To do this, you must first create a _client_ in a _realm_.

Client - The client represents the application being secured. Often, clients are web services that want to use Red Hat Single Sign-On (RHSSO) to secure themselves and provide a single sign-on solution.

Realm - A realm is used to manage a set of users, credentials, roles, and groups. A user belongs to and logs into a realm.
Realms are isolated from one another and can only manage and authenticate the users that they control.

****
*What is Customer Application SSO?*

Customer Application SSO, included with Red Hat Managed Integration, enables you to define the identities of your end users.
Red Hat manages this instance, however there are some additional users with admin level privileges who can configure this instance.
****

IMPORTANT: The realm used in this Solution Pattern is shared with *all* users on the cluster. *Do not use this realm for production applications*.

=== Configuring and protecting the front-end app

Follow these steps to create a client for the front-end app.

. Go to the link:{sso-realm-url}[Master, window="_blank"] realm, which is running on your {customer-sso-name} service.
.. If prompted, log in with your username and password. You will see the *Master* realm if the login is successful.
. Hover the realm dropdown in the top right and click on *Add Realm*.
. In the name field, enter *{realm-name}*.
. Click *Create*. You will be redirected to your new realm.
. Select *Clients* from the vertical navigation menu on the left side of the screen.
. Click the *Create* button on the top right of the Clients screen.
. On the *Add Client* screen:
.. In the *Client ID* field, enter
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
{user-username}-frontend
----
.. Verify the *Client Protocol* is set to *openid-connect*.
.. Click *Save*. You will see the *Settings* screen for the *{user-username}-frontend* client if the save is successful.
. On the *Settings* screen:
.. Change *Valid Redirect URIs* to:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
{route-ionic-showcase-server-host}*
----
.. In the *Web Origins* field, enter `*`.
.. Click the *Save* button.
. Select the *Installation* tab.
. On the *Installation* screen:
.. For the *Format Option*, select *Keycloak OIDC JSON*. You will now see some additional code on the screen.
.. Copy the content displayed or use the *Download* button to save the configuration file.

. Update the configuration of the frontend app to secure it. To do this:
.. Go to the link:{openshift-config-maps-url}[OpenShift Config Maps, window="_blank"] page.
.. Select the item named *webapp-config*.
.. Select the *YAML* tab.
.. Add a new auth section to the showcaseConfig. You can do this by adding `"auth":` and then pasting the content that was copied in the previous step.
+
IMPORTANT: *On the line above where you add the new `"auth":` section, make sure you add a comma (`,`) after that section's closing `}`.*

+
NOTE: The auth section should be at the same level as the existing backend section and indented to match.

.. Rename the `auth-server-url` attribute to `url` and the `resource` attribute to `clientId`.
.. Click *Save*.

----
   window.showcaseConfig = {
     "backend": {
       "serverUrl": "/graphql",
       "wsServerUrl": ((window.location.protocol === "https:") ? "wss://" : "ws://") + window.location.hostname + "/graphql"
     },
     "auth": {
       "realm": "{realm-name}",
       "url": "{user-sso-url}/auth",
   	   "ssl-required": "external",
   	   "clientId": "{user-username}-frontend",
   	   "public-client": true,
   	   "confidential-port": 0
     }
   };
