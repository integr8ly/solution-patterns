== Creating your DataSync project from DataSync Starter template

{data-sync-name} allows you to focus on your business model by giving you ability
to generate fully functional GraphQL based API and Node.js Server and Client Side components.

DataSync will allow your application to recieve live updates thanks to GraphQL subscriptions and
operate independently of network connection. Developers can create GrapQL types as model
and generate underlying backend that will work out of the box with the RHMI services like SSO or AMQ Online

[time=30]
=== Setting your DataSync project using DataSync Starter

. Install yarn `npm install -g yarn`
. Clone git repository: `git clone https://github.com/aerogear/datasync-starter#walkthrough`
. Go to cloned repository: `cd datasync-starter`
. Install dependencies `yarn install`

=== Creating your DataSync model

DataSync model offers capability to generate underlying GraphQL API and database infrastructure.
Starter template by default will use MongoDB database as datasource for storing all your data.

. In your project go to `./model/task.graphql` file.
This file contains GraphQL compatible schema
. Please add `@datasync` annotation to the model right below `@model` annotation
Those annotations can be used to control various behaviour of datasync.
`@model` will create standard data access methods, while `@datasync` is going to provide data synchronization capabilities.
. Models can be changed by adding new types or fields. Please add new field by creating new line inside `Task` type
and `address: String`
. Your task model should look as follows
----
"""
@model
@datasync
"""
type Task {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  description: String!
  status: TaskStatus
  address: String
}
----

=== Generating your DataSync Node.JS server and React Client

DataSync provides code generation capabilities that will transform your model to the fully
functional client and server application.
DataSync-starter template contains the following folders:

- `./server` folder that contains Node.js server implementation
- `./client` folder that contains React based application
- `.graphqlrc.yml`

. Review `.graphqlrc.yml` file. This file contains configuration for your data access methods
and available plugins that will be used for source code generation
. Please make sure that all fields in `crud` section are enabled
. Execute graphback cli command to generate source code:
`yarn graphback generate`
. Review `./server/src/schema/schema.qraphql`.
This file contains your model along with access methods that were enabled in configuration.
. Review generated resolver files in `./server/src/resolvers/resolvers.ts`
This file contains methods used to fetch data. Each individual method will use
preconfigured MongoDataProvider. Developers can point resolvers to any datasource.
Currently Postgres and MongoDB are supported.
. Review your `./client/src/graphql/` folder containing client side queries for your data.

=== Running DataSync client and server applications

. Open new terminal window
. Execute `docker-compose up -d` to start MongoDB container
. Execute `yarn prepare:client` to build client side React application and include it in server runtime
. Execute `yarn start:server`. Terminal should print similar output:

----
    ***********************************************************
    ðŸŽ® Ionic PWA application available at http://localhost:4000/
    ðŸš€ GraphQL Playground is available at http://localhost:4000/graphql
    ***********************************************************
----

. Open `PWA application URL` printed in terminal

[type=verification]
****
. Check if website was loaded properly
. Select + icon to create new item
. On new screen put `name` and `description`
The client should create a task
. New task should appear on the list
****

[type=verificationFail]
****
Check the logs of the Console.
Verify that you followed each step in the procedure above.
If you are still having issues, contact your administrator.
****

=== Interacting with embedded GraphQL Playground

GraphQL Playground acts as GraphQL API client that allows
you to interact with your types without implementing new views in your application.
In this section we are going to focus on learning who to use playground.

. Open new terminal window
. Execute `yarn start:server`
. Open GraphQL Playground URL printed in the terminal.
You can use the GraphQL playground to interact with the server API as described in the next step.
. Go to the Playground interface and replace the text in the left pane of the screen with the following query and mutation:

----
query listTasks {
  allTasks {
    title,
    description,
    address,
    id
  }
}

mutation createTask {
  createTask(title: "complete the walkthrough", description: "complete the GraphQL walkthrough", address: "NA") {
    title,
    description,
    version,
    address,
    id
  }
}
----

[type=verification]
****
. Click the Run icon in the middle of the playground screen.
. Choose createTask from the menu.
The system should create a task.
. Choose listTasks from the Run menu.
. Check that the following is displayed in the right hand panel and that it includes the field we have added in the previous steps
+
----
{
    "data": {
        "allTasks": [
            {
                "title": "complete the walkthrough",
                "description": "complete the GraphQL walkthrough",
                "id": "1",
                "address": "NA"
            }
        ]
    }
}
----
****

[type=verificationFail]
****
Check the logs of the `ionic-showcase-server` pod.

It should include the string `+connected to messaging service+`.
Verify that you followed each step in the procedure above.  If you are still having issues, contact your administrator.

== Running and verifying your DataSync server

The {data-sync-starter} provides:

  - offline operation support
  - out of the box live updates
  - conflict resolution

In this guide we are going to explore the capabilities of datasync by using
a sample application available as part of {data-sync-starter}.
Application by default is designed to work with `Task` model but it can be extended
to use very Type automatically exposed by underlying server GraphQL API.

. Go back to application opened in previous step.
. Create a task by clicking on the plus icon in the bottom right-hand side of the screen.
. Add a title and description, of your choosing, to the task and click *Create*.
. Copy the current url without the '/tasks' endpoint and paste in a different tab, browser or mobile browser.
. Change the status of the task by clicking/unclicking the text box beside the task.


[type=verification]

[time=15]
== Add authentication and authorization to the Data Sync application using Red Hat SSO

In this section, we will configure both the frontend and the backend of the
{data-sync-starter} with the Red Hat SSO.

DataSync starter has authentication and autorization enabled out of the box.
Developers need to configure server and client application to use their keycloak instance
and add required authorization rules to their model.

== Add authorization rule for Task deletion

. Go to your GraphQL Schema `./server/src/config/auth.ts`.
This file contains auth rules for all the operations we support.
. Change role from `delete: { roles: ['admin'] }` to delete: `{ roles: ['test'] }`,
This will only allow deletion for test role that we haven't created.
This operation will prevent us from deleting items from the list.

=== Configuring Authentication for Keycloak (SSO)

. In solution explorer open the User SSO service.
. Login using your own credentials (You might need to open this tab in incognito mode).
. In menu on the left hover over realm name.
. Select `Add new realm`
. Put `DataSync Example` as name and press `Create`
. Select *Clients* from the vertical navigation menu on the left side of the screen.
. Click the *Create* button on the top right of the Clients screen.
. On the *Add Client* screen:
.. In the *Client ID* field, enter
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
public-datasync
----
.. Verify the *Client Protocol* is set to *openid-connect*.
.. Click *Save*.
. You will see the *Settings* screen for the *{client-name}* client if the save is successful.
. on the *Settings* page:
.. Change `Valid Redirect URIs` to hostname used to run your server application with `\*` at the end.
For example `https://routex9wvywuq-codeready-workspaces.apps.openshift.io*`
.. Change `Web Origins` to `\*`
.. Click on the *Save* button
.. Click on the *Installation* tab, and select `Keycloak OIDC JSON` format. Copy the content displayed or use the `Download` button to save the configuration file.
. Create new users for testing:
.. Select *Users* on the left menu, and click on *View all users*.
.. Click on *Add user* to create a new user. Pick a username you like for the *Username* field and click *Save*.
.. Select the *Credentials* tab and set a password for this user. Set *Temporary* option to *OFF*.
.. Click *Reset Password*

=== Testing Keycloak Authentication and Authorization

. Close all opened terminals in Code Ready environment
. Copy `Keycloak OIDC JSON` file into:
.. `server/website/keycloak.json`
.. `server/src/config/keycloak.json`
. Execute `start server`. This command will start GraphQL server with embedded client.
. Open Preview URL in the new window
. Login window should appear.
. Login using credentials you have chosen in keycloak
. Press User icon in the top right corner.
. You should see admin user profile with his roles
. Go back to the task screen
. Try to delete one of the created tasks
. User will not be permitted to delete task as it does not have test role.
