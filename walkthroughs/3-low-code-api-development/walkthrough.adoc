Applications that are designed to run in a containerised environment.

// This is taken right from https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification
*OpenAPI Specification:*

A standard, programming language-agnostic interface description for REST APIs. REST APIs allow both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

In this Solution Pattern you follow a design-first approach, based on the OpenAPI specification, to define a RESTful API that accepts a name parameter and echoes it back in the response body.
You then use the resulting Open API definition to generate the code for your API and deploy it in a containerised environment.

Following a design first approach to API development is self-documenting, and provides a clear API definition for partners and end-users of your API.
It also allows you to identify important design decisions prior to coding and deployment.

== Creating an OpenAPI Spec using API Designer

When creating an API it's beneficial to start from the bottom-up. Creating an
OpenAPI Specification prior to coding forces developers to consider API usage
patterns, provides a blueprint for the API development, and creates an
understanding between the server and clients regarding the behavior of the
API.

An OpenAPI Specification can be defined in YAML/JSON format. In this section
we'll be using API Designer - a visual design tool - to generate this YAML/JSON
document.

=== Create the Base API Definition

Follow these steps to create the base API definition using Red Hat API Designer.

. Go to link:{apicurio-url}[API Designer, window="_blank"]
. Login if prompted and click the new *New API* button.
. Rename your API from "New API" to:
+
----
Greeting API
----
. Edit the *Description* in the *Design* tab on the right under the *INFO* section:
+
----
My greeting API
----
. Click *Add a data type* under the *Data Types* heading on the left of the screen.
. In the *Enter Basic Information* section enter the following in the *Name* field:
+
----
Name
----
. Enter the following JSON in the *Enter JSON Example* field:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
{
    "name": "shadowman"
}
----
. Make sure *No Resource* is selected in the *Choose to create a REST Resource with the Data Type* section.
. Scroll down and click *Save*.

[type=verification]
Is `</> Name` listed under the *Data Types* on the left of the screen?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you followed each step in the procedure above.  If you are still having issues, contact your administrator.


=== Creating a POST Resource Path

Follow these steps to create a *Path*. A *Path* represents an API endpoint and the associated parameters required to invoke it.

. Click *Add a path* under the *Paths* heading of the *Provide API Definition* screen.

. In the window that appears, enter the following in the *Path* field:
+
----
/greeting
----

. Click *Add* to confirm your entry.

. Click your new */greeting* endpoint under the *Paths* heading.
. In the *Operations* section on the right, select the *Post* tab.
. Click the *Add Operation* button. The *POST* tab will change to an orange background color.
. In the expanded *INFO* section, enter the following in the now visible *Summary* field:
+
----
Greet with name
----

. In the *Operation ID* field, enter:
+
----
greetname
----

. In the *REQUEST BODY* section, select the *Add a request body* link.

. For the *Request Body Type*, select *Name*. This is the type you created earlier.
+
NOTE: The drop-down may look inactive. Just click it and you should have the option to select "Name".

. In the *RESPONSES* section, select the *Add a response* link.
.. In the window that appears choose *200 OK* as the option and click the *Add* button.
.. Click *No description* beside the newly listed *200 OK* response, and enter the following in the *Description* field:
+
----
Greeting response
----
.. For the *Response Type*, click *Choose Type* and then select *String*. You will then see an additional drop-down displayed, with the *Type* now showing "*String* as *String*".

=== Export the OpenAPI Spec as JSON/YAML

. On the top right of the screen, click the *angle down icon* next to the *Save As...*  button.
. Select *Save as YAML*.
. On the top right of the screen, click the *Close* button.
. You will see a modal asking you to "Save changes before closing?", so click *Save*.

+
NOTE: Keep this file safe. It will be used to create the API implementation in Fuse Online shortly.

== Creating a Slack Connection in Fuse Online

In Red Hat Fuse Online a *Connection* is used to store the information required to connect to a service such as a message queue, database, or REST API.
For example, a Slack *Connection* in Fuse Online requires an *API Token* and *Slack URL* to function - these are stored in a *Connection* created by a user.

=== Creating a Slack Workspace

. Click *Next* on the *Review Actions* screen to proceed to the *Operations* screen.

[type=verification]
Is a *POST /greeting* operation displayed on the *Operations* screen in Fuse Online?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you created the POST operation correctly in the OpenAPI Spec using API Designer. Contact an administrator if the problem persists.

=== Create a Flow for the API Operation

. Click the *Create flow* button for the *POST /greeting* item. The *Add to Integration* page appears displaying the *Provided API* and the *Provided API Return Path*.
. Click the blue plus icon in the center to add a step.
. Select the *Greeting Slack Target* on the *Choose a connection* screen. This will add a step between the *Provided API* and the *Provided API Return Path*.
. When prompted to *Choose an action* select *Channel*. You can use this to send a message to a specific channel in your Slack workspace.
. Use the *Channel* menu to select the *low-code-demo* channel and click *Next*.
The *Add to Integration* screen should now display your Slack connection with a triangular *Data Type Mismatch* warning icon.
. Click the *Warning Icon* on the Slack *Channel* panel and choose *Add a data mapping step*.
. From the *Data Mapper* screen click the *body* field in the *Source* panel to expand it.
. Click the *name* field under the *body*, then click the *message* field in the *Target* panel. This maps the value of the incoming HTTP request *body* to the outgoing Slack *message* property.
. In the right hand *Mapping Details* panel, click the *Add Transformation* under the *Targets* section to add a transformation.
. Change the transformation type from *Append* to *Prepend*.
. Enter the following in the *string* field under the menu:
+
----
Hello from,
----

{blank}

NOTE: Make sure a space character is added after the comma character.

. Click *Done* to return to the *Add to Integration* screen. This screen should now list your *Provided API Return Path* with a *Data Type Mismatch* warning.

. Click the *Warning Icon* on the *Provided API Return Path* panel and choose *Add a data mapping step*.

. From the *Data Mapper* screen click the *Message* heading in the *Source* panel to expand it.

. Click the *message* field under the *Message* heading in the *Source* panel.
. Select the *body* field in the *Target* panel. This maps the *message* value from the created Slack message to the *body* of the outgoing HTTP response.

. Click *Done* to return to the *Add to Integration* Editor.

. Click *Publish*, then enter the name:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----

. Wait until Fuse Online reports your build and deployment was successful.

[type=verification]
Once the building and deploying stages complete, go to the Fuse Online *Home* screen. Do you see the *Greeting Integration* with a blue box that contains the text *Running*?

[type=verificationFail]
Verify that you followed each step in the procedure above. If you are still having issues, contact your administrator.

[time=5]
== Invoke the API Integration

By default, Fuse Online does not expose an *Integration* to the public internet using an OpenShift *Route*. A straightforward way to test the integration without exposing it to the internet is by creating a link:https://curl.haxx.se[cURL, window="_blank"] container *Deployment*.

*Note:* This step is optional. Feel free to move onto the *Protecting APIs* Solution Pattern to securely expose and invoke this API via Red Hat 3scale API Management.

*Prerequisite:* The `oc` CLI is installed on your development machine. The install instructions are available in the link:https://docs.openshift.com/dedicated/4/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html#cli-installing-cli_cli-developer-commands[OpenShift Documentation, window="_blank"], with binaries available link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest-4.2/[here, window="_blank"].

=== Find the Greeting Service Internal Hostname

. Login to the link:{openshift-console-url}[OpenShift Console, window="_blank"].
. Select the project named with the following format: `fuse-<UNIQUE_ID>`.
. Choose *Applications > Services* from the left menu.
. Select *i-greeting-integration-{user-username}* from the *Services* list.
. Note the *Hostname* listed on the *Service Details* screen. It will have a format similar to `i-greeting-integration-{user-username}.fuse-<UNIQUE_ID>.svc.cluster.local`

=== Creating a cURL Deployment

. Login to OpenShift by using the following command, and entering your password when prompted:
+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
oc login -u {user-username} {openshift-host}
----

. Switch context to the project for this Solution Pattern.

+
[subs="attributes+"]
----
oc project {walkthrough-namespace}
----

. Deploy a cURL container that invokes the *POST /greeting* endpoint using the following command.
Make sure you replace the `INTEGRATION_HOSTNAME` with the one you found previously.

+
----
oc run curl --image=curlimages/curl --restart=Never \
--command -- curl -X POST \
--data '{"name":"OpenShift"}' \
-H 'content-type: application/json' \
http://INTEGRATION_HOSTNAME:8080/greeting -vvv
----

. Verify the cURL container ran successfully by checking the logs for a *200 OK* response with this command:
+
----
oc logs curl
----
{blank}
+
NOTE: To rerun the cURL command you first need to delete Pod from previous runs This can be achieved by running the `oc delete pod curl` command.
. Verify that the message `Hello from, OpenShift` appeared in your `low-code-demo` Slack channel.
